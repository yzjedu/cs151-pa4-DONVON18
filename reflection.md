* Full Name : Donovan Raymond
* Student ID: 1932791

Objective:
1. What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
Designing and programming loops
   1.  Practice with protecting against bad user input 
   2. Practice with writing and reading files 
   3. An opportunity to use looping 
   4. Practice with designing functions 
   5. Practice with implementing for loops 
   6. A chance to be creative

Procedure:
1. What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
   1.  First, I understood the problem 
   2. Next, I wrote an algorithm, talked about it to check if it would work, and asked for approval 
   3. Next, I tested our code
   4. Then I wrote our code and comments 
2. What were the Key concepts explored?
   1. Some of the key concepts explored were error checking, while loops, for loops,
   functions, lists, reading and writing files, and if else statements

Results:
1. Did your results match what you expected to get?
   1. Yes my results are exactly what I wanted and expected 
2. Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?
   1. I used tested but didn't use test cases

Reflection:
1. What challenges did you encounter?
   1.  One challenge that I encountered would be brainstorming patterns.
2. How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
   1. I understood the problem 
   2. Made a plan 
   3. I implemented my plan and tested it
3. Did you overcome them, and how? 
   1. Yes it took some time but all of my issues were handled
4. Any key takeaways? 
   1. A key takeaway for me would be how to use and create functions,use files,
   and use for loops 
5. Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
   1. Yes, I believe I learned everything I was intended to learn 
6. What was it like working by yourself? 
   1. It was hard to check if my naming for variable and functions were good
   because I had no one to check me but besides checking if what im doing 
   is understandable working alone was ok
